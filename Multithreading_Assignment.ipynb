    "# Q1>  what is multithreading in python? why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to simultaneously execute multiple threads of execution within a single process. Threads are lightweight units of execution that allow for concurrent execution of tasks. Each thread runs independently, performing a specific set of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multithreading is used in Python to achieve concurrency, where multiple tasks can be executed concurrently, potentially improving the overall performance and responsiveness of a program. It allows for the execution of multiple threads within a single process, enabling tasks to run in parallel or asynchronously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python provides the \"threading\" module as the primary module for handling threads. It is part of the standard library and offers high-level abstractions for working with threads. The \"threading\" module allows you to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and coordinate thread execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's a simple example that demonstrates the usage of multithreading in Python using the \"threading\" module:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_numbers():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(i)\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_letters():\n",
    "    for letter in 'ABCDE':\n",
    "        print(letter)\n",

    "# D\n",
    "# 5\n",
    "# E\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the above example, two threads, `t1` and `t2`, are created. Each thread executes a different function concurrently. The `start()` method initiates the execution of each thread, and the `join()` method ensures that the main thread waits for the completion of both threads before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's important to note that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallel execution of threads due to internal implementation details. However, multithreading can still be useful for I/O-bound tasks or when working with external processes that release the GIL. For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing or other concurrency models may be more appropriate."
