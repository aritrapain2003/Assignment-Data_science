    "Q1. How do you comment code in Python? What are the different types of comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, you can add comments to your code to make it more understandable and maintainable. Comments are lines of text that are ignored by the Python interpreter when the code is executed. They are used to explain the purpose or functionality of certain parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To add a comment in Python, you can use the # symbol. Everything after the # symbol on a line is considered a comment and is ignored by the interpreter. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "x = 5  # Assign 5 to variable x\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python supports multi-line comments, which are often used to provide detailed explanations or to temporarily disable a block of code. There are two common ways to create multi-line comments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Using triple quotes (''' or \"\"\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "'''\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment.\n",
    "It can span multiple lines.\n",
    "'''\n",
    " 2.Using the # symbol on each line:\n",
    " \n",
    " # This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "# It can span multiple lines\n",
    "Both methods achieve the same result, but using triple quotes allows for more flexibility, such as preserving the comment as a string and using it as a docstring for functions or modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that multi-line comments are not technically \"comments\" in the same sense as single-line comments because they are treated as string literals by the interpreter. However, they serve the purpose of providing descriptive text within the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is considered good practice to include comments in your code to improve its readability and to help others (or your future self) understand the logic and functionality.\n"

    "Q2. What are variables in Python? How do you declare and assign values to variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They act as named placeholders or containers that can hold values of different types, such as numbers, strings, or objects. Variables allow you to refer to data by a symbolic name, making it easier to read and understand your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare and assign a value to a variable in Python, you simply choose a name for the variable and use the assignment operator (=) to assign a value to it. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "x = 5\n",
    "In this example, the variable x is declared and assigned the value 5. From this point on, you can use the variable x in your code to refer to the value 5. For instance, you can perform operations with the variable or display its value:\n",
    "\n",
    "    y = x + 3\n",
    "print(y)  # Output: 8\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to explicitly declare the type of a variable. The type is inferred based on the value assigned to it. For example, in the above code snippet, x is inferred to be an integer because it is assigned the value 5. If you later assign a different type of value to the same variable, the type will be updated accordingly.\n",
    "x = \"Hello\"\n",
    "print(x)  # Output: Hello\n",
    "In this case, x is reassigned a string value, and its type changes to a string. Python allows you to assign values of different types to the same variable during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that variable names in Python must follow certain rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "The name must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "The name can contain letters, digits, and underscores.\n",
    "Variable names are case-sensitive (x and X are different variables).\n",
    "Furthermore, it is good practice to choose descriptive names for your variables that reflect their purpose or the data they hold, as it helps improve code readability.\n",

    "Q3. How do you convert one data type to another in Python?\n",

    "\n",
    "In Python, you can convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or methods. Here are some common ways to perform type conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit Type Conversion: Python automatically performs certain type conversions, known as implicit type conversions or coercion, when operators or functions require operands of different types. For example, if you add an integer and a floating-point number, Python will automatically convert the integer to a float before performing the addition.\n",
    "x = 5      # integer\n",
    "y = 3.14   # float\n",
    "\n",
    "result = x + y   # Implicit conversion: integer to float\n",
    "print(result)    # Output: 8.14\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicit Type Conversion: You can explicitly convert one data type to another using type conversion functions or methods. Here are some commonly used functions:\n",
    "int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n",
    "float(): Converts a value to a float.\n",
    "str(): Converts a value to a string.\n",
    "list(): Converts a sequence to a list.\n",
    "tuple(): Converts a sequence to a tuple.\n",
    "set(): Converts a sequence to a set.\n",
    "dict(): Converts a sequence of key-value pairs to a dictionary.\n",
    "Here are a few examples:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "    x = 5\n",
    "y = \"10\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Convert x to float\n",
    "x_float = float(x)\n",
    "print(x_float)  # Output: 5.0\n",

    "# Convert y to integer\n",
    "y_int = int(y)\n",
    "print(y_int)    # Output: 10\n",

    "# Convert integer to string\n",

    "my_tuple = tuple(my_list)\n",
    "print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when performing type conversions, it's important to ensure that the conversion is valid and makes sense for the given data. For example, converting a string to an integer will fail if the string contains non-numeric characters. In such cases, you may need to handle exceptions or use additional functions like int() with error handling mechanisms.\n",
