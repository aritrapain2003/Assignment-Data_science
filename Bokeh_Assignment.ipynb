    "# Q1. How can you create a Bokeh plot using Python code?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Bokeh plot using Python, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Bokeh: Begin by installing the Bokeh library if you haven't already. You can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "pip install bokeh\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import necessary modules: Import the required modules from the Bokeh library. Typically, you'll need `bokeh.plotting` and `bokeh.io`. You can also import other modules depending on the type of plot you want to create. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prepare data: Prepare the data you want to plot. Create lists or arrays to hold the x and y coordinates of your data points. For example:\n",
    "    \n",
    "x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Configure the plot: Create a `figure` object and configure various properties of the plot such as title, axes labels, and plot size. You can also customize other aspects like line color, marker type, etc. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "p = figure(title='My Bokeh Plot', x_axis_label='X', y_axis_label='Y', plot_width=400, plot_height=300)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add glyphs: Add glyphs (visual markers) to the plot to represent your data points. For instance, you can use the `circle` glyph to create scatter points. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.circle(x, y, size=8, color='blue')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Display the plot: Finally, you need to display the plot. Use the `show` function to render the plot in a web browser or a Jupyter notebook. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! These steps provide a basic outline for creating a Bokeh plot using Python code. You can further customize the plot by exploring the various options and features offered by the Bokeh library."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Bokeh, glyphs are visual markers used to represent data points in a plot. They can be various shapes such as circles, squares, triangles, or even custom shapes. Glyphs allow you to visualize data in a visually appealing and informative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To add glyphs to a Bokeh plot, you can use the glyph methods provided by the `figure` object. These methods create and add glyphs to the plot based on the given data and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's an example of how to add glyphs to a Bokeh plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "from bokeh.plotting import figure, show\n",
    "from bokeh.io import output_notebook\n",

    "p = figure(title='My Bokeh Plot', x_axis_label='X', y_axis_label='Y', plot_width=400, plot_height=300)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add glyphs to the plot\n",
    "p.circle(x, y, size=10, color='blue', alpha=0.5)  # Adding circles\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the plot\n",
    "show(p)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we start by importing the necessary modules and preparing the data points (`x` and `y`). Then, we create a `figure` object and customize its properties, such as the title and axis labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we add glyphs to the plot using the `circle` glyph method (`p.circle`). This method adds circular glyphs to the plot based on the provided data points (`x` and `y`). We can further customize the appearance of the glyphs by specifying parameters such as size, color, and transparency (alpha).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use the `show` function to display the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore other glyph methods available in Bokeh, such as `square`, `triangle`, `line`, etc., and customize their attributes to suit your specific visualization needs."

    "# Q3. How can you customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot, including the axes, title, and legend, you can use various methods and attributes provided by the Bokeh library. Here's a breakdown of how you can customize different aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot Title:\n",
    "   You can set the title of the plot using the `title` attribute of the `figure` object. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p = figure(title='My Bokeh Plot')\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Axes Labels:\n",
    "   You can set labels for the x-axis and y-axis using the `x_axis_label` and `y_axis_label` attributes of the `figure` object. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p = figure(x_axis_label='X-axis', y_axis_label='Y-axis')\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Axis Ticks and Tick Labels:\n",
    "   You can customize the appearance of axis ticks and their labels using various attributes. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p.xaxis.minor_tick_line_color = None  # Remove minor tick lines on the x-axis\n",
    "   p.yaxis.major_label_text_color = 'red'  # Set the color of major tick labels on the y-axis\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Axis Range and Scale:\n",
    "   You can control the range and scale of the axes using the `x_range`, `y_range`, `x_scale`, and `y_scale` attributes of the `figure` object. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p.x_range = (0, 10)  # Set the range of the x-axis\n",
    "   p.y_scale = 'log'  # Use logarithmic scale for the y-axis\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Legend:\n",
    "   To add a legend to your plot, you can use the `legend` attribute of the glyphs you add to the plot. Here's an example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p.circle(x, y, size=8, color='blue', alpha=0.5, legend_label='Data Points')\n",
    "   p.legend.title = 'Legend'  # Set the title of the legend\n",
    "   p.legend.location = 'top_right'  # Position the legend in the top-right corner\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Plot Size:\n",
    "   You can adjust the size of the plot using the `plot_width` and `plot_height` attributes of the `figure` object. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   p = figure(plot_width=800, plot_height=600)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "These are just a few examples of how you can customize the appearance of a Bokeh plot. Bokeh provides many more options and attributes for fine-grained control over various plot elements. You can explore the Bokeh documentation for a comprehensive list of available customization options.\n"

    "# Q4. What is a Bokeh server, and how can you use it to create interactive plots that can be updated in\n",
    "# real time?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bokeh server is a Python server application that allows you to create interactive plots and applications with real-time updates. It enables you to build dynamic and interactive data visualizations that can respond to user interactions or external data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the Bokeh server and create interactive plots that can be updated in real time, you need to follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install Bokeh: Ensure that you have the Bokeh library installed. If not, you can install it using the following command:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   pip install bokeh\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import necessary modules: Import the required modules from the Bokeh library. Typically, you'll need `bokeh.plotting` and `bokeh.io`. Additionally, you'll need the `curdoc` module to access the current document. Here's an example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   from bokeh.plotting import figure, curdoc\n",
    "   from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource\n",
    "   from bokeh.layouts import row\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Prepare data and create a figure: Prepare the data you want to plot and create a `figure` object as usual. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "   p = figure(title='Real-time Plot', x_axis_label='X', y_axis_label='Y')\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create a data source: To enable real-time updates, you'll need to create a `ColumnDataSource` object that holds the data to be plotted. This data source can be updated dynamically to reflect changes in the plot. Here's an example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   source = ColumnDataSource(data={'x': x, 'y': y})\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Update the plot based on user interactions or data changes: Define a callback function that updates the data source and the plot when triggered. This function can be linked to events like button clicks, slider changes, or periodic updates. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   def update():\n",
    "       new_y = [val + 1 for val in source.data['y']]  # Modify the data\n",
    "       source.data['y'] = new_y  # Update the data source\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add interactive elements: Create interactive elements like buttons, sliders, or widgets that trigger the callback function. Here's an example using a button:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   from bokeh.models import Button\n",
    "\n",
    "   button = Button(label='Update')\n",
    "   button.on_click(update)  # Link the button to the callback function\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Arrange the plot and interactive elements: Use layout functions like `row`, `column`, or `gridplot` to arrange the plot and interactive elements. For example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   layout = row(p, button)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run the Bokeh server: Finally, to start the Bokeh server and view the interactive plot in a web browser, you need to use the `curdoc` object and the `curdoc().add_root()` method. Here's an example:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   curdoc().add_root(layout)\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "9. Run the server application: Run the Bokeh server application using the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   bokeh serve --show your_script.py\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `your_script.py` with the filename of your Python script containing the Bokeh code.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps, you can use the Bokeh server to create interactive plots that update in real time based on user interactions or external data changes. The Bokeh server provides a powerful framework for building interactive data visualization applications."
