    "# In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will possess. The attributes represent the state of the object, while the methods define the behaviors or actions that the object can perform.\n",

    "# An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a tangible entity that exists in memory and has its own set of attributes and methods inherited from the class. Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each having its own unique state but sharing the same structure and behavior defined by the class.\n",

    "# Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class, hiding the internal details and providing a public interface to interact with the object. It allows for data abstraction, ensuring that the object's internal state is accessed and modified only through defined methods, providing better control and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (called a child class or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a parent class or base class). The child class can reuse the attributes and methods of the parent class, and also add its own unique attributes and methods. Inheritance promotes code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method or message in different ways. It allows the same method name to be used in different classes, and each class can provide its own implementation. Polymorphism enables code flexibility and allows for code to be written in a more generic and reusable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It focuses on capturing the common properties and behaviors of objects and creating abstract classes or interfaces. Abstraction allows programmers to work with simplified models and handle complex systems by breaking them down into manageable parts. It helps in managing the complexity of large-scale software development.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pillars are fundamental concepts in OOP, and they provide a solid foundation for building modular, reusable, and maintainable software systems."

    "# Q3. Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python classes that is automatically called when an object is created from the class. It is known as the constructor because it initializes the object's attributes and performs any other necessary setup operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `__init__()` function is used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Initialize object attributes: It allows you to assign initial values to the object's attributes. These attributes represent the state or data associated with the object and define its unique characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Set up the object's initial state: The `__init__()` method can perform operations or calculations to set up the initial state of the object. This can include initializing variables, opening files or connections, or any other necessary setup steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Accept arguments during object creation: The `__init__()` method can accept parameters that are passed during the creation of the object. These arguments provide a way to provide initial values for the object's attributes or configure its state based on specific inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's an example to illustrate the usage of `__init__()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def introduce(self):\n",

    "# Creating a Person object\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 25)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing object attributes\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(person1.age)   # Output: 25\n",
    "\n",
    "# Calling object method\n",
    "person1.introduce()  # Output: Hi, my name is Alice and I am 25 years old.\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the above example, the `Person` class has an `__init__()` method that takes two parameters, `name` and `age`. When a new object is created from the class, such as `person1`, the `__init__()` method is automatically invoked with the provided arguments. Inside the method, the values of `name` and `age` are assigned to the object's attributes (`self.name` and `self.age`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# By using `__init__()` in this way, we can ensure that each `Person` object is created with its own unique `name` and `age` attributes, allowing us to store and manipulate individual data for each person."

    "# Q4. Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python, `self` is a conventionally used parameter name within a class method that refers to the instance of the class itself. It is a reference to the object on which the method is being called. The `self` parameter allows the methods to access and manipulate the attributes and other methods of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the reasons why `self` is used in OOP in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Differentiating instance attributes: The `self` parameter allows us to differentiate between instance attributes (specific to each object) and local variables within a method. By using `self.attribute_name`, we can access or modify the instance attributes of the object. It ensures that the changes are made to the specific object on which the method is called, rather than affecting other objects of the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accessing other methods and attributes: The `self` parameter provides a way to access other methods and attributes of the same object within a class. By using `self.method_name()` or `self.attribute_name`, we can invoke other methods or access attributes of the object. This allows for better encapsulation and promotes code organization within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enabling method invocation: When a method is called on an object, the object itself is implicitly passed as the first argument. By convention, this first argument is named `self`. It enables the invocation of methods in the object-oriented paradigm, as the object can reference and invoke its own methods through the `self` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Supporting inheritance and polymorphism: The `self` parameter is crucial for inheritance and polymorphism, two fundamental principles of OOP. When a child class inherits from a parent class, the `self` parameter allows the child class to override and extend the parent class's methods while still maintaining access to the parent's methods and attributes. It ensures that the correct object instance is used, preserving the behavior of the specific class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the `self` parameter plays a vital role in Python's OOP to differentiate instance attributes, access other methods and attributes, enable method invocation, and support inheritance and polymorphism. By using `self`, we can effectively work with object instances and maintain the integrity of the class structure.\n"
