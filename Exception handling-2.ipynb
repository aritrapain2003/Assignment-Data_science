    "# Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a custom exception in Python, it is recommended to inherit from the built-in `Exception` class or one of its subclasses. Here are a few reasons why using the `Exception` class as the base class for custom exceptions is beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consistency: Inheriting from the `Exception` class ensures that your custom exception follows the same design and behavior as other built-in exceptions in Python. It adheres to the conventions and expectations of exception handling in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Catch-All Capability: By inheriting from the `Exception` class, your custom exception becomes a catch-all exception. This means that if you catch the base `Exception` class, it will also catch instances of your custom exception. This provides flexibility in handling different types of exceptions in a more general manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Compatibility: The `Exception` class is compatible with a wide range of exception handling mechanisms in Python. It integrates well with the `try-except` statement, allows for multi-level exception handling, and works seamlessly with other built-in and third-party libraries that utilize the standard exception hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clarity and Readability: Using the `Exception` class as the base class for your custom exception makes your code more readable and self-explanatory. It clearly indicates that your custom exception is intended to represent an exceptional condition or an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "By inheriting from the `Exception` class, you ensure that your custom exception behaves as expected within the Python exception handling framework, making it easier to handle and reason about exceptions in your codebase."
