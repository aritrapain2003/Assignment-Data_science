    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans :\n",
    "Q1. A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It serves as a centralized repository for storing and managing large amounts of structured or unstructured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and overall approach to data storage and retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SQL Databases (Relational Databases):\n",
    "SQL databases, also known as relational databases, are based on the relational model. They organize and store data in tables with rows and columns, where the relationships between tables are defined by keys. SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases. Some popular SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of SQL databases:\n",
    "- Structured data: SQL databases require a predefined schema, which defines the structure and relationships of the data.\n",
    "- ACID properties: SQL databases typically adhere to the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "- Joins: SQL databases allow for complex queries involving multiple tables using join operations.\n",
    "- Scalability: SQL databases can scale vertically (by adding more powerful hardware) or horizontally (by adding more servers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. NoSQL Databases (Non-Relational Databases):\n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name implies, are non-relational databases that provide flexible data models for unstructured and semi-structured data. They are designed to handle large volumes of data with high velocity and variety. NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph-based. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Couchbase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of NoSQL databases:\n",
    "- Flexible schema: NoSQL databases allow for dynamic and schema-less data structures, enabling easier handling of unstructured data.\n",
    "- Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, allowing for distributed storage and processing across multiple nodes.\n",
    "- High performance: NoSQL databases prioritize high-speed data retrieval and can handle large amounts of data with low latency.\n",
    "- Eventual consistency: NoSQL databases often relax the ACID properties to provide high availability and scalability, sacrificing immediate consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on various factors, including the nature of the data, scalability requirements, performance needs, and the specific use case of the application. Each type has its strengths and weaknesses, and the selection should align with the requirements of the project at hand.\n"

    "# Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and manage the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations and examples of the commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, or schemas. It defines the structure and attributes of the object being created. For example, to create a table named \"Employees\" with columns for \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "   CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "       ID INT,\n",
    "       Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       Salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP statement is used to remove database objects from the database. It permanently deletes the specified object and its associated data. For example, to drop the previously created \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "   DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object. It allows you to add, modify, or delete columns, constraints, or indexes. For example, to add a new column named \"Department\" to the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "   ADD Department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table while keeping its structure intact. It is faster than the DELETE statement because it doesn't log individual row deletions. For example, to remove all data from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements are essential for managing the structure and organization of a database. They allow you to create, modify, and remove database objects, providing flexibility and control over the database's structure and contents."

    "DML stands for Data Manipulation Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to manipulate and retrieve data within a database. DML statements are used to insert, update, and delete data in database tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the explanations and examples of the commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT: The INSERT statement is used to add new rows of data into a table. It allows you to specify the values for each column or insert data from another table. For example, to insert a new employee into the \"Employees\" table with the values for \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "   INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary)\n",
    "   VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 5000);\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE: The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing data in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns for specific rows that meet certain conditions. For example, to update the salary of the employee with ID 1 in the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "   UPDATE Employees\n",
    "   SET Salary = 6000\n",
    "   WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE: The DELETE statement is used to remove one or more rows from a table. It allows you to specify conditions to identify the rows to be deleted. For example, to delete the employee with ID 1 from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "   WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These DML statements provide the means to manipulate and retrieve data within a database. They allow you to insert new data, update existing data, and delete unwanted data, enabling you to maintain and control the information stored in the database tables."

    "# Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a sub-language of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is primarily used for retrieving and querying data from a relational database. DQL provides a set of commands and syntax for specifying the data to be retrieved and the conditions that need to be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most commonly used command in DQL is the SELECT statement. It is used to retrieve data from one or more database tables based on specified criteria. Here's an example of a SELECT statement:\n",

    "- **SELECT**: This keyword indicates that we want to retrieve specific columns from the table.\n",
    "- **column1, column2, ...**: These are the names of the columns we want to retrieve data from. We can specify multiple columns separated by commas, or use an asterisk (*) to select all columns.\n",
    "- **FROM**: This keyword specifies the table from which we want to retrieve the data.\n",
    "- **table_name**: This is the name of the table where the data is stored.\n",
    "- **WHERE**: This keyword is used to specify conditions that the retrieved data must meet. It is optional.\n",
    "- **condition**: This is the condition that determines which rows will be included in the result. It typically consists of column names, comparison operators, and values.\n",
    "\n",

    "SELECT FirstName, LastName\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Salary > 50000;\n",

    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of relational databases, a primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts that establish relationships between tables. Let's understand each of them:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Primary Key**:\n",
    "A primary key is a unique identifier for a specific record in a database table. It ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identifiable. The primary key enforces data integrity and provides a way to uniquely identify and access individual records within a table. Here are some key characteristics of a primary key:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uniqueness: Each value in the primary key column must be unique. No two records in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "- Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot have a null value. It must always have a valid value for each record.\n",
    "- Immutable: Once a primary key value is assigned to a record, it should not be changed. This ensures the integrity of the primary key's reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, a primary key is created using one or more columns in a table that uniquely identify each row. Examples of primary key columns could include a customer ID, product code, or employee ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Foreign Key**:\n",
    "A foreign key establishes a relationship between two database tables. It is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The foreign key defines a link between the two tables based on the values of the corresponding columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key characteristics of a foreign key:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Referential Integrity: The foreign key ensures referential integrity, meaning that the values in the foreign key column(s) must match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. This ensures that the relationship between the tables is valid.\n",
    "- Relationship: The foreign key represents a relationship between the table containing the foreign key and the referenced table. It establishes a connection between related records in different tables.\n",
    "- Optional or Mandatory: Depending on the design, a foreign key relationship can be optional or mandatory. An optional foreign key allows null values, indicating that the relationship may not be present for some records. A mandatory foreign key requires a valid value, indicating that the relationship must exist for all records.\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign keys are used to maintain data integrity and enforce relationships between tables. They enable the creation of relationships like one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many between different tables in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that primary keys and foreign keys are not limited to a single column; they can involve multiple columns as well."

    "1. `cursor()` method: The `cursor()` method is used to create a cursor object. The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch the results. It acts as a pointer to the result set returned by the database. In the example code, `cursor = cnx.cursor()` creates a cursor object named `cursor`.\n",

    "2. `execute()` method: The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries or statements. It takes an SQL query as a parameter and sends it to the MySQL server for execution. In the example code, `cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM your_table\")` executes the SQL query to select all rows from the \"your_table\" table. You can pass any valid SQL query or statement to the `execute()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "   After executing the query, you can retrieve the results using methods like `fetchall()`, `fetchone()`, or `fetchmany()`, depending on your requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `fetchall()`: Retrieves all rows from the result set.\n",
    "   - `fetchone()`: Retrieves the next row from the result set.\n",
    "   - `fetchmany(size)`: Retrieves the specified number of rows from the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the example code, `result = cursor.fetchall()` retrieves all rows from the result set and stores them in the `result` variable.\n",
