    "5. **Determine the Critical Value:**\n",
    "   To determine the critical value, you need to find the critical F-value from an F-distribution table or a statistical calculator. Since you want to conduct the test at the 5% significance level, you can find the critical F-value for a two-tailed test with degrees of freedom `(df1 = n₁ - 1)` and `(df2 = n₂ - 1)`, where `n₁` and `n₂` are the sample sizes for Restaurant A and Restaurant B, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Compare Test Statistic and Critical Value:**\n",
    "   Compare the calculated test statistic (F) with the critical value. If the test statistic is greater than the critical value, reject the null hypothesis; otherwise, fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Draw a Conclusion:**\n",
    "   Based on the comparison between the test statistic and the critical value, draw a conclusion about whether the variances of the waiting times at the two restaurants are significantly different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that this analysis assumes that the samples are randomly selected and that the populations follow a normal distribution."
