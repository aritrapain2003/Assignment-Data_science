    "# Abstraction is a fundamental principle in object-oriented programming (OOP) that involves representing essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It focuses on capturing the common properties and behaviors of objects and creating abstract classes or interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, abstraction can be achieved through abstract classes and interfaces using the built-in `abc` module (Abstract Base Classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's an example to illustrate abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# ```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",

    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",

    "dog.sound()  # Output: Woof!\n",
    "cat.sound()  # Output: Meow!\n",
    "# ```\n",
    "\n",
    "# In the above example, `Animal` is an abstract class defined using the `ABC` class from the `abc` module. It contains an abstract method `sound()` decorated with the `@abstractmethod` decorator. The `sound()` method is declared in the abstract class but does not have any implementation. This indicates that any concrete class inheriting from `Animal` must provide an implementation for the `sound()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `Dog` and `Cat` classes inherit from the `Animal` abstract class and provide their own implementations for the `sound()` method. These concrete classes are required to implement the abstract method defined in the abstract class. They can define their own additional methods and attributes as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "# By using abstraction, the common behavior of making a sound is captured in the abstract class `Animal`, while the specific sound implementation is left to the concrete classes `Dog` and `Cat`. Code that interacts with `Animal` objects can rely on the fact that they have a `sound()` method, without needing to know the specific details of how each concrete class implements it. This abstraction allows for code flexibility and facilitates the management of complex systems by breaking them down into manageable and interchangeable parts."

    "# Q3. What is abc module in python? Why is it used?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes.\" It is a built-in module that provides infrastructure for defining abstract base classes (ABCs) in Python. ABCs are classes that cannot be instantiated and are meant to be subclassed by concrete classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is used for defining and working with abstract base classes. It provides the `ABC` class and the `abstractmethod` decorator, which are used to define abstract methods in abstract base classes. An abstract method is a method declared in an abstract base class but does not have an implementation. Concrete subclasses derived from the abstract base class are required to provide an implementation for these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is used for the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Defining abstract base classes: The `abc` module allows you to define abstract base classes by subclassing the `ABC` class provided by the module. This indicates that the class is intended to be an abstract base class and cannot be instantiated on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Declaring abstract methods: The `abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module is used to declare abstract methods within abstract base classes. An abstract method is a method without an implementation in the abstract base class. Concrete subclasses derived from the abstract base class must provide an implementation for these abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Enforcing subclassing: By defining abstract base classes using the `abc` module, you can enforce that subclasses must adhere to a specific interface or provide certain functionality. This helps in defining contracts and ensuring that all subclasses implement the required methods.\n",

    "4. Polymorphism: Abstract base classes allow for polymorphic behavior. Code that interacts with objects based on abstract base classes can work with any concrete subclass that provides the required functionality. This promotes code flexibility and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the `abc` module provides the necessary tools to define abstract base classes, declare abstract methods, enforce subclassing, and enable polymorphic behavior in Python. It is commonly used when you want to define a common interface or contract that subclasses must adhere to while allowing for variation in implementation."

    "# Q4. How can we achieve data abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction can be achieved in Python through the use of classes and objects. By encapsulating data within classes and exposing only necessary interfaces, we can achieve data abstraction. Here's how it can be done:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a class: Start by defining a class that represents the abstraction you want to achieve. The class should encapsulate the data and provide methods to interact with that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hide implementation details: Encapsulate the data within the class by making them private or using naming conventions to indicate that they are intended to be internal to the class. This hides the implementation details and prevents direct access to the data from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Provide public methods: Define public methods within the class that expose the necessary interfaces to interact with the data. These methods should provide a simplified and abstracted way of accessing and manipulating the data, while hiding the internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Access data through methods: Encourage the use of these public methods to access and modify the data within the class. By providing well-designed methods, you can control the access to the data, enforce validation or business logic, and maintain data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example demonstrating data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class BankAccount:\n",
