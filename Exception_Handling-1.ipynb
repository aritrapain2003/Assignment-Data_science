    "# what is exception in python ?  write the  difference between exception and syntax error?\n",

    "# In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, it can be caught and handled by an exception handler, preventing the program from terminating abruptly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions in Python are used to handle various types of errors or exceptional conditions that may occur during the execution of a program. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero or access an index outside the bounds of a list, Python will raise an exception to indicate that something went wrong.\n",

    "# Now, let's discuss the difference between an exception and a syntax error in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.Syntax Error: Syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter encounters code that violates the language's grammar rules. These errors are detected during the parsing or compilation phase, before the program is executed. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all. They often occur due to incorrect syntax, such as missing colons, parentheses, or incorrect indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's an example of a syntax error:\n",
    "print(\"Hello, world!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#  2.Exception: Exceptions occur during the runtime of a program when an error or an exceptional condition is encountered. Unlike syntax errors, exceptions can be caught and handled by the program. Exceptions can be raised explicitly by the programmer or implicitly by the interpreter or built-in functions.\n",
